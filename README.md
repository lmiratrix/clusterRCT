# clusterRCT - code for analyzing blocked, cluster-randomized trials

# USERS TAKE NOTE

This package is under development, and I would not use it if I were you.  (The package is public only to make things easy to put on cluster computing.) We will eventually remove this message! :-)


# Introduction
This is the companion codebase for a large-scale comparison of different estimators applied to a suite of cluster RCT experiments in Education and the social sciences.

Core methods are `compare_methods()` which compares the estimates from a collection of different estimation strategies on a given dataset, and `describe_clusterRCT()` which describes overall characteristics of a given dataset.
